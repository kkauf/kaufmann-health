# Therapist Profile Reminders â€“ Vercel Cron Setup

This document describes how to schedule server-side reminders for therapists who have not completed their profile (documents, profile photo, approach text).

## Endpoints

- `POST /admin/api/therapists/reminders`
  - Auth: Admin cookie OR Cron secret (`x-cron-secret` header or `?token=...` query string) matching `CRON_SECRET`.
  - Body: `{ limit?: number, stage?: string }`
  - Returns: `{ data: { processed, sent, skipped_no_missing, examples }, error }`

- `POST /admin/api/therapists/:id/reminder`
  - Manual reminder for one therapist (admin cookie required).

## Why

- Server-side reminders keep the public site cookie-free.
- Business logic (what is "missing") stays in the backend and can evolve with schema.
- One secure endpoint allows flexible scheduling (daily/weekly) without deploying new clients.

## Environment

Add to `.env.local` (see `.env.example`):

```bash
# choose a long random value (e.g., openssl rand -base64 32)
CRON_SECRET="<your-secret>"
```

## Vercel Cron

Recommended: configure schedules in `vercel.json`.

```json
{
  "crons": [
    { "path": "/admin/api/therapists/reminders", "schedule": "0 9 * * *" },      
    { "path": "/admin/api/therapists/reminders", "schedule": "30 9 */3 * *" },   
    { "path": "/admin/api/therapists/reminders", "schedule": "0 10 * * 1" }     
  ]
}
```

Notes:
- Method is GET by default. Our endpoint supports GET and requires no body.
- If `CRON_SECRET` is set, Vercel includes `Authorization: Bearer <CRON_SECRET>` in requests. Our endpoint authorizes using that header.
- Query params (`?stage=...&limit=...`) are optional; not required for basic operation. You can add them to `path` if desired, but most setups keep it simple and derive defaults server-side.

You can also trigger jobs from the Cron Jobs UI using a Path (no domain). Headers are not configurable in the UI; rely on the `Authorization` header Vercel adds automatically when `CRON_SECRET` is present.

Observe stats in the JSON response or via events (`email_attempted`, `therapist_documents_uploaded`).

## Local Helper

You can trigger a batch locally (useful for testing):

```bash
# .env.local must include CRON_SECRET and BASE_URL/NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL
npm run reminders:run -- --stage="Erinnerung" --limit=50
```

This calls `POST /admin/api/therapists/reminders` with the secret header and prints the server response.

## Observability

- Each email send emits `email_attempted` with `source` and `stage` (e.g., `therapist_profile_reminder`).
- The upload API emits `therapist_documents_uploaded` with:
  - `license: boolean`
  - `specialization_count: number`
  - `profile_photo: boolean`
  - `approach_text: boolean`

These are queryable via the `public.events` table in Supabase for funnel metrics.
