# Security Decisions (What matters and why)

- __Service role only on server__: `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is used exclusively in API routes (Node runtime). Never expose to the browser. Why: service role bypasses RLSâ€”treat the route as the policy boundary.
- __RLS enabled__ on `people` and `matches`. Current policy allows all operations for `authenticated` users. Note: service role bypasses RLS; public lead capture is intentionally server-controlled. Tighten policies as auth requirements emerge.
- __Input hardening__: `/api/leads` sanitizes strings (control chars removed, length capped) and validates email. Why: prevent low-effort injection/spam and malformed data.
- __Timezone safety__: `created_at` is `timestamptz`. Why: avoid cross-timezone ambiguity.
- __PII considerations__: Emails/phones are PII. Ensure production logs avoid sensitive payloads. Consider retention and encryption requirements before scale.
- __Abuse controls__: Add rate limiting (IP-based), bot protection (Turnstile/reCAPTCHA) for public lead forms. Why: service route is intentionally open to accept new leads.
