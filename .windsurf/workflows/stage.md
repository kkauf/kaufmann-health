Stage all changes that were touches in this conversation only.
Create a Conventional Committ message for the changes.
Write an update to the Linear task and move it to done.
If no Linear task was indicated, confirm with the user whether a new task should be created. This ALWAYS makes sense for larger changes (>100 lines of code changed, i.e. you don't need to confirm with the user).
The user will push changes themselves.
